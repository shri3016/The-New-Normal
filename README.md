**Main Functionalities**

- Consider a workplace where a person is assigned to check the temperature using thermal scanners, but with this project we are going to eliminate them, and it will automatically get checked.


-  At the entry there will be a face scanner along with the thermal cameras, if the person wearing mask is given a green signal then the thermal camera will check the temperature, and in the workplace people who don’t follow social distancing will enclosed in red box as per the code and that would be deployed in the security cameras, the same can be used in streets as well.

- The working model of this project can potentially be used as the ‘back-end’ to monitoring systems in places where a crowd of people tend to accumulate such as Workplaces, Avenues, Transport stations (eg. Railway station), Parks, etc. The real-time inputs can be fed in to the monitoring system through CCTV cameras installed in such locations and the outputs (people who are violating social distancing) can be viewed on the monitors. Continuous violation of the norm can warrant for immediate clearance & more stringent rules in that area.

**Extensions**

Temperature Screening: Elevated internal heat level is another vital side effect of COVID-19 disease. At present situation warm screening is finished utilizing handheld contactless IR thermometers where wellbeing laborer needed to come in vicinity of the individual should be screened which makes the wellbeing of laborers in jeopardy. Warm cameras based screening to dissect internal heat level of the people groups out in the open places that can add another assistance to requirement offices to handle the pandemic adequately can be added as a further extension to our project.
